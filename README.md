# guidcb

Simple just for fun C++ Windows console application to generate a GUID and copy it to the clipboard.

The main idea is to include the `guidcb.exe` in the system `PATH` and use it in the `cmd` or `PowerShell` to generate a GUID and copy it to the clipboard and from there, paste it wherever you need it.
